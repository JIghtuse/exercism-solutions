# Robot Name

Write a program that manages robot factory settings.

When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.

The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated, such as
RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings,
which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will
respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
Random names means a risk of collisions. Your solution should not allow
the use of the same name twice when avoidable. In some exercism language
tracks there are tests to ensure that the same name is never used twice.

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Crates and Modules](crates-and-modules) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
