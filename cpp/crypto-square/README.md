# Crypto Square

Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.

The input is first normalized: The spaces and punctuation are removed
from the English text and the message is downcased.

Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  These rows can be
regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.

For example, the sentence

> If man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots

is 54 characters long.

Broken into 8-character columns, it yields 7 rows.

Those 7 rows produce this rectangle when printed one per line:

```plain
ifmanwas
meanttos
tayonthe
groundgo
dwouldha
vegivenu
sroots
```

The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to
right.

For example, the message above is coded as:

```plain
imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn sseoau
```

Write a program that, given an English text, outputs the encoded version
of that text.

The size of the square (number of columns) should be decided by the
length of the message.

If the message is a length that creates a perfect square (e.g. 4, 9, 16,
25, 36, etc), use that number of columns.

If the message doesn't fit neatly into a square, choose the number of
columns that corresponds to the smallest square that is larger than the
number of characters in the message.

For example, a message 4 characters long should use a 2 x 2 square. A
message that is 81 characters long would use a square that is 9 columns
wide.

A message between 5 and 8 characters long should use a rectangle 3
characters wide.

Output the encoded text grouped by column.

For example:

- "Have a nice day. Feed the dog & chill out!"
  - Normalizes to: "haveanicedayfeedthedogchillout"
  - Which has length: 30
  - And splits into 5 6-character rows:
    - "havean"
    - "iceday"
    - "feedth"
    - "edogch"
    - "illout"
  - Which yields a ciphertext beginning: "hifei acedl v…"

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read [the C++ page](http://exercism.io/languages/cpp) on
exercism.io.  This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.

## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).
Create just enough structure by declaring namespaces, functions, classes,
etc., to satisfy any compiler errors and get the test to fail.  Then write
just enough code to get the test to pass.  Once you've done that,
uncomment the next test by moving the following line past the next test.

```C++
#if defined(EXERCISM_RUN_ALL_TESTS)
```

This may result in compile errors as new constructs may be invoked that
you haven't yet declared or defined.  Again, fix the compile errors minimally
to get a failing test, then change the code minimally to pass the test,
refactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then
go on to the next test.

Try to use standard C++11 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.  [CppReference](http://en.cppreference.com/)
is a wiki reference to the C++ language and standard library.  If you
are new to C++, but have programmed in C, beware of
[C traps and pitfalls](http://www.slideshare.net/LegalizeAdulthood/c-traps-and-pitfalls-for-c-programmers).
